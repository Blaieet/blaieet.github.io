					<li><h2><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Blaieet/Product-Recomender-With-Chatbot">Product Recommender with Chatbot</a></h2> <p>
						In my 4 years of college I've done many projects of any kind. One of the most challenging ones was developing a Chatbot able to list your supermarket items and make suggestions about them. 
						The Chatbot was made with Telegram, due to that his API is tremendously simple and easy-to-learn. The algorithm behind the recommender logic was initially done with the Apriori algorithm, but later on was upgraded with an approximation of the Page-Rank algorithm. You can check the project in my public repository.

					<li><h2><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/rohit-nlp/discrimination-web-app">Detecting discrimination trough Suppes-Bayes Causal Network</a></h2> <p>Developed with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://eurecat.org/en/">Eurecat</a>, this project was part of my bachelor thesis. The idea was to develop a tool that would combine two lines of work: the internal representation of the data, with an entry in the database representing a person and all its attributes, and mathematical problems based on assessing risks of reidentification or discrimination of an individual based on their characteristics.</p>
						<p>Starting with the techniques given in the paper <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs41060-016-0040-z">"Exposing the probabilistic causal structure of discrimination"</a>, I developed an algorithm that allowed the extraction of graphical probabilistic models that after being trained by likelihood-fit they transform into a Suppes-Bayes Causal Networks (SBCN). The generated SBCN could be exploited with random walk methods that provided information about the presence of discrimination and its level, if any.</p>

						<p>Once I had the algorithm working I designed and deployed a fully-functional website that enabled any user to upload their dataset and extract all the information that my algorithm provided in a visual and easy-to-understand way.</p>
						<p>The 100% of this project code is open-sourced and open for any future extension. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12ta5mAYn_H_jlzm7jM6DsEvHPYLxJsX6/view?usp=sharing">My 80-page paper is also available for everyone</a>, but I also made a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NIskrka9c3oIXcqk81QWkTKTTRGKLZEM/view?usp=sharing">small and simple presentation</a> so you don't have to read it all ðŸ¤“.</p></li>

					<li><h2><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Blaieet/Master-thesis">Accuracy comparison in high-dimensional product sales forecasting with inter-product relationships and promotions</a></h2>
						<p>Developed alongside <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.accenture.com/es-es/services/applied-intelligence-index?">Accenture</a>, the aim of this project was the comparison between a modified Vector Autoregressive model, specialized in detecting product relationships, and a Machine Learning traditional model, XGBoost, developed by Accenture. I built a framework able to pre-process, adapt, train and compare and evaluate both models, using Python and R.<br>
						The conclusions of my work were based on accuracy results using more than 4 forecast evaluation metrics and promotion & product relationships associations. The XGBoost implementation remains private since it was developed by Accenture. You can take a look at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Blaieet/Master-thesis/blob/main/Master%20Thesis%20Report%20-%20Blai%20Ras.pdf">thesis report</a> for further explaination.</p>
